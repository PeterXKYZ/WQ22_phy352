Problem 1: 
Let F_n = 1.476, F_n+1 = 1.479, F_n-1 = 1.4595.
The Feigenbaum constant Î´ is (F_n - F_n-1) / (F_n+1 - F_n) = 5.5
which is uh, a little bit off.

TECHNICAL COMMENTS:
- the plots are generated with Python's Matplotlib cuz I'm running out of time and didn't want 
to fiddle with gnuplot.
- the Python scripts may not be compatible with an outdated Matplotlib package on Quest. (Works with Mpl 3.4.2)
- the Python scripts should be run in the pyplot/ folder.
- since Problem 2 has many subparts, I split up the problem 2 into three mains.
